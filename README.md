# KDC: An Open Corpus for Computational Research of Dastgāhi Music

### Babak Nikzat and Rafael Caro Repetto

This repository will contain the code used for analyzing the **KUG Dastgāhi Corpus** (**KDC**). The obtained results and some of the resulting plots are presented and discussed in the paper:

> B. Nikzat, and R. Caro Repetto. 2022. "KDC: An Open Corpus for Computational Research of Dastgāahi Music." In *Proc. of the 23rd Int.
Society for Music Information Retrieval Conf.*, 321-328. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316660](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316660)

As a result of the review process, and attending the useful suggestions from the reviewers, the *KDC* is in process of being restructured. Consequently, the code should be rewritten according to the new structure of the corpus, in order to produce the same results presented in the mentioned paper.

In the meantime, the data, with its original structure, and the corresponding code are available in the following repository: [https://ln5.sync.com/dl/15243b270/uznw3nwd-t7g8mgxs-epk98yvu-vyiww5yg](https://ln5.sync.com/dl/15243b270/uznw3nwd-t7g8mgxs-epk98yvu-vyiww5yg)
